# PIC_PS2_to_UART

This projects uses the PIC16f1705. It reads a PS/2 keyboard and outputs a TTL UART signal. The Output is 8 bit ASCII.

The PCBs used with this project are:

1. PS2 to UART 6pin_revA
2. PS2 to UART 6pin_revB
3. Arduino PS_2_shield
4. PS2 to UART 6pin_revC
5. PS2 to UART RS232_revA
6. PS2 to UART RS232_revB
7. PS2 to UART RS232_revC
